# Development

In order to run the Javascript files, dependencies will have to be installed. Make sure to navigate to the root of the project:

    $ cd fp_team_14
    $ npm install

The JS files itself are written in ES6, hence the necessity for the code to be transpiled with something like Webpack:

    $ npm run clean
    $ npm run build

# Todo

- Test Firebase in JS
